I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria (Paris) in the team [Argo](https://www.inria.fr/en/argo). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in 2020. Prior to Inria (Paris), I was at Inria (Sophia Antipolis) as a postdoctoral researcher in the team [Neo](https://team.inria.fr/neo/).

#### Research Interests

 My research is in the areas of control and distributed optimization in wireless networks, queueing systems and energy markets.I use techniques from applied probability, queueing theory, Markov desision processes, control theory, game theory and optimization. My work includes: 

- Equilibria in multi agent games with irrational agents
- Revenue maximization in server farms and multi agent games
- Distributed Control, Optimization and Quality-of-Service in wireless networks
