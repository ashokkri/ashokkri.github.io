I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria (Paris) in the team [Argo](https://www.inria.fr/en/argo). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in 2020. Prior to Inria (Paris), I was at Inria (Sophia Antipolis) as a postdoctoral researcher in the team [Neo](https://team.inria.fr/neo/).

#### Research Interests

 My research is in the area of network resource allocation and control. This involves techniques from applied probability, queueing theory, Markov desision processes, control theory, game theory and optimization. My work includes  

- Multi agent games in markets: Equilibria and Control
- Revenue maximization in resource allocation
- Control and Optimization in wireless networks
- Delivering Quality-of-Service in wireless systems
- Distributed optimization in wireless networks
